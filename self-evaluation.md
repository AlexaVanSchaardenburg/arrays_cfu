## Self Eval
- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I am feeling good about arrays, what makes me most nervous is how many methods there are, but I feel confident in my ability to quickly and effectively find their types and functions on the internet and using Mozilla/MDM
- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I think the pairing session will sodify my knowledge, other than that I feel good! 
- What questions do you have about Arrays?
How many types of array methods are there? If you want to print out a list of all the elements in the array to the console, is it possible to do so without printing the square brackets and commas? I have a lot of littel questions, but none feel pressing.
